Find uses two roles in IDOL Community to allow access to the application.  This only affects Find for IDOL - Find for Haven OnDemand does not use these roles.

# Roles
- `FindUser` - has access to all search functionality of the application
- `FindAdmin` - (RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE) will have access to admin functionality of the application in the future
