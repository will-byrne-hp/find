# Branches and Tags

We use [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for our branching model.

## Branch Structure
- `master` is the latest "known good" version of the code
- `develop` is the bleeding edge version of the code, which will contain unreleased and potentially unstable features
- `feature/*` contains unfinished features that are not yet ready for release
- `release/*` contains temporary release branches.  At the end of every "sprint" (sprints are two-week long periods of work), we take a release branch from `develop`, e.g. `release/sprint77`.  We test the branch and fix any high-priority bugs that are discovered.  Two weeks later (at the end of the following sprint) we finish the release branch and merge the known-good code into the `master` branch.
- `onprem-release/*` branches track released version of Find for IDOL customers.
- Any other branches can be safely ignored at this stage.  Treat them as feature branches.

## Tag Structure
We have two types of tags - fixed tags that track a specific version (e.g. `v1.0.3`), and floating tags that track a commit that is deployed somewhere (e.g. `hsod-preview`).
